# brainf_on_OCaml
This is a quick little piece of code I made (dated: October 2025), to both learn OCaml and to help me debug my own BrainF*** code.

It might be a bit messy (couldn't spend too much time refining it), and was not designed to be released to the public. 
Just some code I wrote to challenge myself, and learn both languages in the process.
